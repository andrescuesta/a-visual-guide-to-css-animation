### Envato Tuts+ Course: A Visual Guide to CSS Animation
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

It’s now possible to create awesome animation effects using pure CSS, without a scrap of JavaScript in sight. In this course you’ll learn how to create CSS animations powered by the `transition` and `transform` properties.

And because animations are highly visual, rather than getting bogged down in code we’re going to be learning visually. We’ll be using Webflow’s popular visual web design tool (via a free account) so you’ll see your animations play out in real time, as you create them.

**Note**: The files in this repository are SVG graphics which can be used to follow along.
